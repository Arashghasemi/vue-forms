# Pluralsight Course: Vue 3 Forms

There are two versions of the startup project. In the `3.0` folder, you'll
find the Vue CLI version (for Vue 3.0). This course is from 2020.

If you're using the newer course with Vue 3.2 (and Vite), please use the example in the `3.2` folder. This is the course released in 2023.

You can find the 3.0 course at https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/vue-building-forms.
